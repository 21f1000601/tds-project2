# Automated Data Analysis with autolysis.py

This project utilizes a Python script, `autolysis.py`, to perform automated data analysis on CSV files using GPT-4o-Mini. The script generates insights, visualizations, and narrative reports through the LLM.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Large Language Model (LLM)
- GPT-4o-Mini
- AI Proxy

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib (See `requirements.txt` for complete list)

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-repo.git

2. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
To run the script, use the following command in the terminal:

python autolysis.py your_dataset.csv

Ensure that `your_dataset.csv` is the path to the CSV file you want to analyze.

## AI Proxy Token
You will need an AI Proxy token to communicate with GPT-4o-Mini. Ensure it is correctly set in your environment variables or configured in the script.

## Output
The script will output the analysis results in a narrative format along with charts in the output directory specified within the script.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the script or extend its functionality are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
